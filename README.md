# Word Search API

This project provides a simple API to generate word search grids based on a list of words. It uses Flask as the web framework and allows users to send a list of words via a POST request to generate a word search grid. The API returns a JSON object representing the grid and the words that are contained.

## Features

- **Word Search Generation**: Send a list of words to the API, and it will return a grid with the words placed in random locations along with words that are contained.
- **POST Method**: Accepts `POST` requests containing a JSON object with a list of words.
- **JSON Response**: Returns a JSON object representing the generated word search grid along with the words that are contained.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- `requests` (for testing)
- `flask_cors` (for enabling CORS)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imjamesonzeller/wordsearchapi.git
cd word-search-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install Flask and CORS manually:

```bash
pip install Flask flask_cors
```

### 3. Run the Flask API Server

Start the Flask server by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`. If you want to deploy it to a different IP or port, you can modify the `app.run()` call in `app.py`.

## WordSearch Class

The core of the word search generator is the `WordSearch` class, which takes a list of words and generates a grid that places each word randomly within the grid. 

### Class: `WordSearch`

#### Methods:

- **`__init__(self, words)`**  
  Initializes the `WordSearch` object with a list of words and sets up the grid. The grid size is computed based on the number of words and the length of the words. It ensures that only words of valid lengths are placed on the grid.

- **`__computeGridSize(self)`**  
  Calculates an appropriate size for the word search grid based on the number of words and their average lengths. It ensures that the grid is large enough to fit the words in a random pattern.

- **`__randomCoords(self)`**  
  Returns a tuple of random coordinates within the grid.

- **`__valid_direction(self, word, coords)`**  
  Checks if a word can be placed at the given coordinates in any of the 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). This method also verifies that the word fits within the grid and that it doesn't overlap with existing words incorrectly.

- **`__place_word(self, word, coords, direction)`**  
  Places the word at the given coordinates in the grid, following the chosen direction.

- **`__fillBlankIn(self)`**  
  Fills in all the remaining empty spaces in the grid with random letters.

- **`generate_word_search(self)`**  
  The main method that generates the word search. It iterates through the list of words, places each word randomly on the grid, and then fills in the blank spaces with random letters.

- **Word Length Validation**: During word placement, the code ensures that each word is properly placed without exceeding the grid size or overlapping with other words incorrectly. The grid size is automatically adjusted to accommodate the longest word in the list.

### Example of Grid Generation

Hereâ€™s an example of how the `generate_word_search()` method works:

1. **Input**: A list of words, e.g., `["PYTHON", "FLASK", "WEB", "SEARCH", "CODE"]`.
2. **Output**: A grid with those words placed randomly in 8 possible directions, with remaining empty spaces filled with random letters.

Example grid before random letter insertion:

```json
[
  ["P", "Y", "T", "H", "O", "N", "", "", "", ""],
  ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
  ["", "", "", "", "", "B", "E", "W", "", ""],
  ["", "F", "", "", "", "S", "", "", "", ""],
  ["", "", "L", "", "E", "", "", "", "", ""],
  ["", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
  ["", "", "R", "", "S", "", "", "", "", "C"],
  ["", "C", "", "", "", "K", "", "", "", "O"],
  ["H", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "D"],
  ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "E"]
]
```

## API Endpoints

### `POST /generate_word_search`

This endpoint accepts a list of words and returns a generated word search grid in a JSON format.

#### Request

- **URL**: `/generate_word_search`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**: A JSON object with a key `words` containing a list of words.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "words": ["PYTHON", "FLASK", "WEB", "SEARCH", "CODE"]
}
```

#### Response

The response will be a JSON object representing the word search grid.

Example response:

```json
{
  "search": [
    ["P", "Y", "T", "H", "O", "N", "", "", "", ""],
    ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
    ["", "", "", "", "", "B", "E", "W", "", ""],
    ["", "F", "", "", "", "S", "", "", "", ""],
    ["", "", "L", "", "E", "", "", "", "", ""],
    ["", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
    ["", "", "R", "", "S", "", "", "", "", "C"],
    ["", "C", "", "", "", "K", "", "", "", "O"],
    ["H", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "D"],
    ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "E"]
  ],
  "words": ["PYTHON", "FLASK", "WEB", "SEARCH", "CODE"]
}
```

#### Error Responses

- **400 Bad Request**: If an invalid request is sent (e.g., missing words), the server responds with a default list of  15 randomly selected words and generates the grid.

- **404 Not Found**: If the endpoint is incorrect or unavailable.
  
- **500 Internal Server Error**: If there is a server-side error.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using a tool like **Postman** or **cURL**. Here's how to do it with **cURL**:

### Example cURL Request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate_word_search \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"words": ["PYTHON", "FLASK", "WEB", "SEARCH", "CODE"]}'
```

If successful, you'll receive a JSON response with the generated word search grid and contained words.

### Example Python Test Script

You can also test the API with the following Python script using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests
import json

# URL of your Flask API endpoint
url = 'http://localhost:5000/generate_word_search'

# Example list of words
words = ["PYTHON", "FLASK", "WEB", "SEARCH", "CODE"]

# Data to send in the POST request body
data = {
    "words": words
}

# Send the POST request to the Flask API
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the generated word search grid (JSON response)
    print("Word search generated successfully!")
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

The test.py file also works well with better formating for CLI word searches.

### Dependencies for Testing

If you're testing the API using Python, you'll need to install the `requests` library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Code Explanation

### `app.py`

The Flask API is defined in `app.py`. The key parts of the code are:

- **CORS**: This is enabled to allow cross-origin requests, which is particularly useful if you're hosting the API and front-end on different domains.
  
- **POST `/generate_word_search`**: The main endpoint where users can send a list of words. If no words are provided, a default list of random words from words.py will be used. The `WordSearch` class is used to generate the word search grid.

- **Error Handling**: If an invalid request is sent (e.g., missing words), the server responds with a default list of words and generates the grid.
